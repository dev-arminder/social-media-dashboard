![Design preview for the Social Media Dashboard](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge I had build.
Look At [**Live Version**](https://dev-arminder.github.io/social-media-dashboard/)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users  are able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Technologies I had Used
- **HTML** - For Markup
- **CSS** - For Styling Purpose
- **Js** - For Scripting 
- **BEM** - [Block Element Modifier As naming convention](http://getbem.com/) 
- **Github Page** - [For Deployment](https://pages.github.com/)

## Running Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-arminder/social-media-dashboard.git
